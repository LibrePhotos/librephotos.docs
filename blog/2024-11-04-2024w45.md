**Upstream:**

- 🚀 LibrePhotos: Reintroduce Classification

This change aims to reintroduce classification, while keeping the current clustering intact. Clustering was chosen, because it works well in a cold start scenario, where the user does not have any persons. Common problems with clustering are that there is no way to only match faces to known persons, and that previous input does not improve the clustering results. Classification should solve this problem! Instead of finding all the clusters, classification will match all unknown faces with already known persons instead.

- ✨ LibrePhotos: Faces are now only soft deleted
- ✨ LibrePhotos: All cluster and classification probabilities are now saved
- ✨ Frontend: New Light box for viewing images
- ✨ Frontend: You can now delete faces from the lightbox
- ✨ Frontend: Hovering over a name in the sidebar, will outline the face
- ✨ Frontend: There is now a separate "Unknown" section in the face dashboard
- ✨ Frontend: Inferred faces are now the first tab, instead of the last
- ✨ Frontend: New filter for viewing cluster or classifications
- ✨ Frontend: New filter for label probability
- ✨ Frontend: Photo details now return, if the face was inferred or labelled and the probability
- ✨ Frontend: The face of the person and the old name are now visible when renaming
- ✨ LibrePhotos: Updated dependencies and updated language strings from the community
