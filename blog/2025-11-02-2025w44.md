**Breaking change:** Postgres v18+: change your volume mount path!

With Postgres v18+, mounting a volume to `/var/lib/postgresql/data` can fail in Docker/Kubernetes due to an upstream change that enforces a new data directory (`/var/lib/postgresql/MAJOR/docker`) and adds a symlink from `/var/lib/postgresql/data` to `/var/lib/postgresql` ([details](https://github.com/docker-library/postgres/pull/1259)).

**Action required:** Mount your volume to `/var/lib/postgresql` instead. `pgautoupgrade` will detect any existing data there and migrate it to the new structure (discussion: [pgautoupgrade#164](https://github.com/pgautoupgrade/docker-pgautoupgrade/issues/164)).

**Upstream:**

- 🚀 LibrePhotos/Frontend: You can now edit GPS locations
- ✨ Frontend: Upgraded to Mantine 8.3 and fixed linting errors (Implemented by [sickelap](https://github.com/sickelap))
- ✨ LibrePhotos: Using Argon2PasswordHasher for new and updated accounts for faster authentication
- 🔨 LibrePhotos: Handle empty recently added photo queries
- 🔨 LibrePhotos: Fix BLIP on newer versions of librephotos
- 🔨 LibrePhotos: Fix proxy redirects for non-ASCII original photo paths
- 🔨 LibrePhotos: Fix LLM models downloading even when none was selected
- 🔨 Frontend: Fix a bug when uploading images
- ✨ LibrePhotos: Updated dependencies and updated language strings from the community
