**Upstream:**

- 🚀 LibrePhotos: Split up scan job in smaller tasks

This is a pretty big change. Instead of doing all the work for each image, we will now prioritize creating a thumbnail and making the image visible in the UI and pushing other tasks like looking for faces or generating tags later.

- ✨ LibrePhotos: Updated dependencies and updated language strings from the community
- ✨ LibrePhotos API: Job progress is now reported slightly different
- ✨ LibrePhotos/Frontend: Merge minor versions automatically
- ✨ LibrePhotos: Default background worker is now the number of cores of the host system
