**Upstream:**

- 🚀 Frontend: Switched from RTK Query and Redux to Tanstack Query

The syntax of RTK Query was difficult to work with, and Redux introduced unnecessary complexity for our needs. With TanStack Query, data fetching feels much more natural and removes the need for boilerplate like slices or global state management for async data.

- 🚀 Frontend: Switched from React Router to Tanstack Router

Switching to TanStack Router improves consistency with TanStack Query, enables typesafe URL-based state management, and supports powerful features like intent-based fetching — all with deeper integration options out of the box.

- ✨ Frontend: Overhauled Face Dashboard controls
- ✨ Frontend: Add keyboard navigation to the lightbox
- ✨ LibrePhotos: Disable password change on demo site (Implemented by [sickelap](https://github.com/sickelap))
- ✨ LibrePhotos: Extracted a thumbnail model from the photo model
- ✨ LibrePhotos: Updated dependencies and updated language strings from the community
- 🔨 Frontend: Fixed a lot of small issues
