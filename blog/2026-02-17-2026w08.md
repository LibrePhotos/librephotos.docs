This release introduces a multi-model tagging system, giving you the choice of two different AI models for auto-tagging your photos.

**Upstream:**

- 🚀 LibrePhotos/Frontend: Multi-Model Tagging System
  - You can now choose between two tagging models in **Site Settings → Tagging Model**:
    - **Places365** — The classic scene recognition model (default)
    - **SigLIP 2** — Google's latest vision-language model, running as ONNX. Uses zero-shot classification against a curated vocabulary of 900+ real-world photo tags (people, animals, nature, activities, scenes, weather, and more). Returns the top 10 most relevant tags.
  - Tags are stored **per model** — switching between models does not delete previously generated tags, and does not require rescanning your library.
  - The lightbox sidebar now shows tags with **color-coded badges** for each model (green for SigLIP 2, blue for Places365).
  - Things Albums are dynamically filtered to only show tags from the currently active tagging model.
  - Search results use tags from the selected model.
