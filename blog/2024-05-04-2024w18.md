**Upstream:**

✨ LibrePhotos: Improved service management
The services now get started with Django and there is a cron job, which checks if the service is still running. There are now a bunch of new endpoints for handling services.
[GET] /services/: List all services
[GET] /services/{id}/: Retrieve the health status of a service
[POST] /services/{id}/start/: Start a service
[POST] /services/{id}/stop/: Stop a service

- 🔨 LibrePhotos: Do not download model, if "none" is selected
- 🔨 LibrePhotos: Chain download and dependents together
- 🔨 Frontend: Fix updating avatar (Implemented by [sickelap](https://github.com/sickelap))
- 🔨 Frontend: Always show header, even when there are no images
- ✨ Docker: Updated to Ubuntu 24.04 and removed build tools
- ✨ LibrePhotos: Updated a bunch of dependencies and updated language strings from the community
