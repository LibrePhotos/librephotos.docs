**Upstream:**

- 🔨 Frontend: Blacklist auth tokens on logout ([Found by ZeroPath's Beta Business Logic scanner](https://zeropath.com/))
- ✨ LibrePhotos: Updated dependencies and updated language strings from the community
- ✨ LibrePhotos: New auth token blacklist endpoint ([Found by ZeroPath's Beta Business Logic scanner](https://zeropath.com/))
- ✨ LibrePhotos: Enhanced support for UhuruPhotos by expanding the PhotoSummary endpoints with additional fields. If you're using the UhuruPhotos app, be sure to update your LibrePhotos instance to ensure compatibility, as older versions will not work with the latest app update.

**Upcoming:**

I know, that not that many things got shipped this month, so here is an overview of things to come next month:

[Reintroduce Face Classification](https://github.com/LibrePhotos/librephotos/pull/1418)

This pull request aims to reintroduce classification, while keeping the current clustering intact. Clustering was chosen, because it works well in a cold start scenario, where the user does not have any persons. Common problems with clustering are that there is no way to only match faces to known persons, and that previous input does not improve the clustering results. Classification should solve this problem for large datasets, where all persons are already known and it respects previous user input. Due to the large scale of this change, this was not ready for shipping yet.

[Upgrade to Mantine 7](https://github.com/LibrePhotos/librephotos-frontend/pull/529):

As a component library, we use Mantine, which had a big version jump to version 7. This version removes emotion for styles and improves SSR capabilities while adding a lot of new components. However, due to the switch from emotion to native CSS and huge list of things that need to migrated, this took longer then expected.
