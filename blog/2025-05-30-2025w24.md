**Upstream:**

🚀 Backend: Added Moondream 2 for caption generation

The backend integrated the Moondream 2 model (via llama-cpp-python) for image+text analysis, marking images as multi-modal inputs. This lays groundwork for more advanced AI features like richer automatic captions or visual queries by allowing the AI to handle both image and text together.

✨ Frontend: Keyboard shortcuts in Lightbox

You can now use keyboard shortcuts in the lightbox to navigate photos, toggle the info sidebar, and even delete images – all without touching the mouse! Helpful tooltips have been added to the UI to remind you of these new shortcuts

Smaller things:

- ✨ Backend: Refactored photo captioning and search
- ✨ Backend: Resolved some noisy logger warnings (Implemented by [emmanuel-ferdman](https://github.com/emmanuel-ferdman))
- 🔨 Backend: Normal users can now create albums again
- ✨ Frontend: It is now possible to delete images from the lightbox
- 🔨 Frontend: Fixed the download photos action
- 🔨 Frontend: Fixed the places tree page
- 🔨 Frontend: Fixed mobile view of photos
