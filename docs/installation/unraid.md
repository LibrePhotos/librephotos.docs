## Docker Compose

You have to download docker-compose. You can add the following to your /boot/config/go file to make sure it's always available:

```bash
curl -L "https://github.com/docker/compose/releases/download/v2.5.0/docker-compose-$(uname -s)-$(uname -m)" -o /usr/local/bin/docker-compose
chmod +x /usr/local/bin/docker-compose
```

Check if it's working:

```bash
docker-compose --version
```

You'll need to create a folder under /mnt/user (e.g. librephotos) within there you'll need two files:

```bash
mkdir /mnt/user/librephotos && cd /mnt/user/librephotos
```

Download this file and save it as .env:

```bash
wget -O .env https://raw.githubusercontent.com/LibrePhotos/librephotos-docker/main/librephotos.env
```

â€‹Download this file to the same directory, but keep the original name:

```bash
wget https://raw.githubusercontent.com/LibrePhotos/librephotos-docker/main/docker-compose.yml
```

You'll need to edit the .env file with paths to your photos (myPhotos) and possibly the timeZone variable. Optionally, you'll want to grab a mapbox API key as documented in the file. Keep note of the default HTTP port, 3000.
You should have LibrePhotos accessible after a few minutes of boot-up on unraidip:3000 unless you changed this in the .env file.

â€‹Once done, you can fire up the containers by typing:

```bash
docker-compose up -d
```

This will cause the containers to startup in the background. You can check the status of them by running:

```bash
docker logs {container name}
```

You can get a name for each of the containers by typing:

```bash
docker ps | grep librephoto
```

Finally, you can access the UI by going to http://unraidip:3000

Furthermore, you can also monitor progress from shell prompt by tailing this file:

```bash
tail -f librephotos_logs/ownphotos.log
```

To shut everything down:

```bash
docker-compose down
```

If you want to grab any updates, you can type:

```bash
docker-compose pull
```

## docker-compose issues when rebooting

After a reboot, docker-compose is not installed anymore, since unRAID loads everything from ram. Someone created a Docker Compose Manager app in the Apps catalog for unRAID. This makes sure docker-compose is installed every time you reboot unRAID, and they are currently working on a Web GUI.

Thanks to [u/Tusc00](https://old.reddit.com/user/Tusc00) and Martijn (Spiek90) for this [write-up](https://old.reddit.com/r/unRAID/comments/knaniy/librephotos/goeyy4l/)!
