## Photo Viewer (Lightbox)

When you click on any photo in LibrePhotos, it opens in the photo viewer (also known as the lightbox). This provides a full-screen view of your photo with navigation controls and a details sidebar.

### Navigation

- **Arrow keys** or **swipe** to navigate between photos
- **Thumbnail bar** at the bottom shows nearby photos for quick navigation
- **Close button** (X) or press **Escape** to return to the gallery

### Toolbar

The toolbar at the top provides quick actions:

- **Toggle sidebar** - Show or hide the photo details panel
- **Favorite** - Mark the photo as a favorite
- **Download** - Download the original photo
- **Share** - Share the photo with other users
- **Delete** - Move the photo to trash

## Photo Details Sidebar

The sidebar displays detailed information about the current photo and provides quick access to related content.

### Timestamp

Shows when the photo was taken. You can click the edit button to modify the date and time if needed.

### File Versions

If there are multiple versions of the same photo (e.g., edited copies or motion photos), they will be displayed here for easy access.

### Location

Displays the location where the photo was taken (if GPS data is available). A small map preview shows the exact location, and clicking it will open a larger map view. You can also edit the location if it's missing or incorrect.

### People

Shows faces detected in the photo. You can:

- Click on a face to view all photos of that person
- Edit the person's name by clicking the edit button
- Mark a face as "Not this person" if incorrectly identified

### Caption

The AI-generated or manually entered caption for the photo. You can:

- View scene, attributes, and category tags
- Edit the caption manually
- Generate a new AI caption

### Albums

Shows which user albums contain this photo. Each album is displayed with:

- **Cover photo thumbnail** - A preview of the album's cover
- **Album title** - Click to navigate directly to that album
- **Photo count** - Number of photos in the album

This makes it easy to see the context of a photo and quickly jump to related albums without leaving the photo viewer.

### Similar Photos

Displays photos that are visually similar to the current one. This is useful for:

- Finding duplicates
- Discovering related photos from the same event
- Browsing photos with similar content

Click on any similar photo to view it directly.
