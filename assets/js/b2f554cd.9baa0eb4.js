A lot has changed since the last release. Here is an overview of all the new features, improvements and bug fixes.\\n\\n**Upstream:**\\n\\n\ud83d\ude80 LibrePhotos: Photo Stacks & File Variants\\n\\nInspired by PhotoPrism, RAW+JPEG pairs and Live Photos are now treated as a single photo entity with multiple file variants, instead of creating separate entries. The scanner now uses a two-phase architecture: first grouping files by directory and basename, then processing each group together. A new repair job automatically merges any previously ungrouped file variants after each scan. This comes with a completely new UI for viewing and managing stacks, file variants in the lightbox sidebar, RAW badge overlays, and a unified organizing page for stacks and duplicates.\\n\\n\ud83d\ude80 LibrePhotos: Duplicate Detection\\n\\nA brand-new duplicate detection system using perceptual hashing! It detects exact copies via hash comparison and visual duplicates using a memory-efficient two-pass algorithm that works well even with very large collections. The API supports a batch_size parameter to fine-tune performance for your hardware.\\n\\n\ud83d\ude80 LibrePhotos: Photo UUID Primary Key & Structured Metadata\\n\\nThe Photo model\'s primary key has been changed from image_hash to UUID, which is a massive internal refactor touching models, APIs, serializers, background tasks, and tests. Alongside this, a new structured PhotoMetadata model with edit history has been added, enabling richer metadata management.\\n\\n\ud83d\ude80 Frontend: Public Album Sharing Options\\n\\nPublic album sharing now supports fine-grained per-album settings. You can control the visibility of location, camera info, timestamps, captions, and faces for each shared album. Default sharing preferences can be configured in user settings, and individual albums can override them.\\n\\n\ud83d\ude80 Frontend: Slideshow Mode\\n\\nA new slideshow mode has been added to the lightbox with a configurable slide interval. Sit back and enjoy your photos!\\n\\n\ud83d\ude80 Frontend: Explore Page\\n\\nThe navigation dropdown has been replaced with a dedicated explore page, giving you a much better overview of your albums, people, places, things and events at a glance.\\n\\n\ud83d\ude80 Frontend: Redesigned Album & Statistics Pages\\n\\nThe album page and all statistics/data visualization pages (face clusters, social graph, word clouds, timeline, place tree) have been completely redesigned with a fresh new look.\\n\\n\ud83d\ude80 Frontend: Spotlight Search\\n\\nA new spotlight search powered by Mantine replaces the old search bar, providing a faster and more intuitive search experience with keyboard navigation.\\n\\n\ud83d\ude80 Frontend: Select All\\n\\nYou can now select all photos in a view for bulk operations like deleting, sharing, or adding to albums.\\n\\n- \u2728 LibrePhotos: Switch from Photon to Nominatim as default reverse geocoding provider\\n- \u2728 LibrePhotos: New endpoint for getting all albums for a photo\\n- \u2728 LibrePhotos: Improved scan error handling and stack detection\\n- \u2728 LibrePhotos: Split directory_watcher into a well-structured package with two-phase scan\\n- \u2728 LibrePhotos: Social graph error logging improvements\\n- \u2728 LibrePhotos: ARM CPU instruction set detection refactored and fixed\\n- \u2728 LibrePhotos: Add SQLite support for UUID primary key migration\\n- \u2728 Frontend: Fullscreen mode in lightbox\\n- \u2728 Frontend: Switched to MapLibre GL with PhotoPrism tile server for all map views\\n- \u2728 Frontend: Improved UX for setting photo location with geocode search\\n- \u2728 Frontend: Improved UX for albums with cover picker and better album list view\\n- \u2728 Frontend: New languages added to the UI\\n- \u2728 Frontend: Improved first time setup experience and default empty state messages\\n- \u2728 Frontend: File variants UI in photo details sidebar\\n- \u2728 Frontend: Metadata section component in lightbox\\n- \u2728 Frontend: Download options now include stacked/variant photos\\n- \u2728 Frontend: Improved scrolling behavior\\n- \u2728 Frontend: Extract inline styles into CSS modules (Implemented by [sickelap](https://github.com/sickelap))\\n- \u2728 Frontend: Replaced airbnb ESLint config with eslint:recommended + prettier;

Clustering was chosen, because it works well in a cold start scenario, where the user does not have any persons. Common problems with clustering are that there is no way to only match faces to known persons, and that previous input does not improve the clustering results. Classification should solve this problem for large datasets, where all persons are already known and it respects previous user input. Due to the large scale of this change, this was not ready for shipping yet.\\n\\n[Upgrade to Mantine 7](https://github.com/LibrePhotos/librephotos-frontend/pull/529):\\n\\nAs a component library, we use Mantine, which had a big version jump to version 7. This version removes emotion for styles and improves SSR capabilities while adding a lot of new components. However, due to the switch from emotion to native CSS and huge list of things that need to migrated, this took longer then expected.\\n\\n---\\n\\nIf you are interested on how I develop this application, you can watch me develop features live on **[my channel](https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCZJ2pk2BPKxwbuCV9LWDR0w)**\\n\\n---\\n\\n**Sponsoring development:**\\n\\nMy work is sponsored by **6** awesome people!\\n\\nIf you like the work I do, then you can support me via **[GitHub sponsors](https://github.com/sponsors/derneuere)** or via **[PayPal](https://www.paypal.com/donate/?hosted_button_id=5JWVM2UR4LM96)**"},{"id":"2024w36","metadata":{"permalink":"/blog/2024w36","editUrl":"https://github.com/LibrePhotos/librephotos.docs/tree/master/blog/2024-08-31-2024w36.md","source":"@site/blog/2024-08-31-2024w36.md","title":"Development: 2024 - August","description":"Upstream:","date":"2024-08-31T00:00:00.000Z","formattedDate":"August 31, 2024","tags":[{"label":"release","permalink":"/blog/tags/release"}],"readingTime":0.775,"hasTruncateMarker":false,"authors":[{"name":"Niaz Faridani-Rad","title":"Maintainer of LibrePhotos","url":"https://github.com/derneuere","imageURL":"https://github.com/derneuere.png","key":"niaz"}],"frontMatter":{"slug":"2024w36","title":"Development: 2024 - August","authors":["niaz"],"tags":["release"]},"prevItem":{"title":"Development: 2024 - September","permalink":"/blog/2024w40"},"nextItem":{"title":"Development: 2024 - July","permalink":"/blog/2024w32"}},"content":"**Upstream:**\\n\\n- \ud83d\udd28 LibrePhotos GPU: Fixed build issues\\n- \ud83d\udd28 LibrePhotos: Fixed an issue where it was possible to upload images with authentication\\n- \ud83d\udd28 LibrePhotos: Fix path traversal issue when uploading an image (Fixed by [adventure8812](https://github.com/adventure8812))\\n- \ud83d\udd28 Frontend: Fix removing missing photos\\n- \ud83d\udd28 Frontend: Tokens will now be saved in the cookies instead of session storage\\n- \u2728 LibrePhotos: Updated dependencies and updated language strings from the community\\n- \u2728 LibrePhotos: Photos are now soft removed in order to improve the last modified query parameter for album date endpoints.
